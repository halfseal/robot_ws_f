/home/sp/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/setuptools/dist.py:745: SetuptoolsDeprecationWarning: Invalid dash-separated options
!!

        ********************************************************************************
        Usage of dash-separated 'script-dir' will not be supported in future
        versions. Please use the underscore name 'script_dir' instead.

        By 2023-Sep-26, you need to update your project and remove deprecated calls
        or your builds will no longer be supported.

        See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html for details.
